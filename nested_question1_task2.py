# Task 2: Setting the Scene

# Based on the corrected code from Task 1, expand the game. If the user chooses "cave", instead of printing "You find a hidden treasure!" ask them if they want to "light a torch" or "proceed in the dark", and provide outcomes for each decision.

place = input("Choose a place: forest or cave? ")

if place == "forest":
    action = input("climb a tree or cross a river?")
    if action == "climb a tree":
        print("You found a bird's nest!")
    elif action == "cross a river":
        print("You found a boat!")
elif place == "cave":
    action = input("light a torch or proceed in the dark?")
    if action == "light a torch":
        print("great idea!")
    elif action == "proceed in the dark":
        print("Let's goooo! Best of luck!")
